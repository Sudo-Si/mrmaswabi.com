It's a step up from my 8Ball and Rock Paper Scissors apps, and writing a blog about it helped me master the basics of React statehooks. The project itself is a journal and showcase for the everyday adventures of an Afro-Kiwi.",

And since I'm a developer, why not use my skills to build a store from scratch and leverage the JAM stack? That way, I can create a unique and personal space for my 3D prints, and maybe even help other 3D printing enthusiasts along the way.",
